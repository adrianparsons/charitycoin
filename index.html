<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>

<p>CharityCoin is a free, open, crowd-sourced directory linking charities to their Bitcoin wallets. It's like onename or keybase, but the information is compiled, organized, and verified by people like you.</p>

<p>I think Bitcoin and nonprofits are a natural fit, and <a href="http://avc.com/2014/07/video-of-the-week-my-talk-on-bitcoin-crowdfunding-and-charitable-giving/">I'm not alone</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin enable fast and efficient transfers of money. No credit card processing fees, no waiting days for ACH transfers to clear. Some nonprofits publish their bitcoin wallet addresses, but that information is currently not available from a reliable, verifiable source.</p>

<p>Once this data is in a structured format, there are a lot of cool things that can be done with it. Really inventive APIs or services could be built with this information.</p>

<a id="how-do-you-verify-bitcoin-addresses" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-verify-bitcoin-addresses" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you verify bitcoin addresses?</h3>

<p>Right now, a simple python script grabs the markup from the url listed in the "confirmation" field in each entry. The script checks that the address is present in the markup. This script is run on TravisCI for every pull request and every commit to master. I verify that the domain matches the domain listed for the nonprofit on <a href="http://guidestar.org">guidestar</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-can-i-get-involved" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-get-involved" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I get involved?</h3>

<p>There are 1.3 million registered nonprofits, and a growing number accept bitcoin. This is not a job for one person. The most direct way to help is to <a href="https://github.com/charity-coin/directory/issues">submit an issue</a> or (for the nerds) submit a pull request for an organization that should be listed but isn't.</p>
<p>If you want to make a technical contribution or build something with this data, please do, and let me know how I can help. I'm spending 12 weeks launching this project.
