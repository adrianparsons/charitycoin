{"name":"Charitycoin","tagline":"","body":"## Bring Donations to the digital age.\r\n### What is this?\r\nCharityCoin is a free, open, crowd-sourced directory linking charities to their Bitcoin wallets. It's like onename or keybase, but the information is compiled, organized, and verified by people like you.\r\n\r\n### Why on earth would anyone want to do this?\r\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin enable fast and efficient transfers of money. No credit card processing fees, no waiting days for ACH transfers to clear. Some nonprofits publish their bitcoin wallet addresses, but that information is currently not available from a single, reliable source.\r\n\r\n### What are you going to do with this information?\r\nOnce this data is in a structured format, it's easy to export or migrate to a database. Eventually I'd like to host an API for looking up bitcoin addresses.\r\n\r\n### How do you verify bitcoin addresses?\r\nRight now, a simple python script grabs the markup from the url listed in the \"confirmation\" field in each entry. The script checks that the address is present in the markup. This script is run on TravisCI for every pull request and every commit to master. If there's a missmatch, the build will be labeled as \"failing\". There may be better ways to do this. If you know of any, get in touch!\r\n\r\n### How can I get involved?\r\nThere are 1.3 million registered nonprofits, and a growing number accept bitcoin. This is not a job for one person. The most direct way to help is to submit an issue or a pull request for an organization that should be listed but isn't.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
